# 2L

1L_a is a recreational programming language. For further information, please visit its [Esolang article].

Neither src/HelloWorld.2l nor poiuy_qwert's hello world from esolangs article don't work in Graue interpreter because they rely on Gregor's implementation, 
where the actions going up and down are reversed. Graue interpreter can be compiled with POINTER_REVERSE defined to achive this behavior.
